<h1 style="font-family:'04b 30'; color:rgba(33, 251, 24, 1.00)"> Competitive gaming </h1>
    The rising popularity of esports combined with live service games has led to a much more competitive landscape within gaming.
    over the years online multiplayer games receive continuous updates in the form of new content and gameplay. 
    moreover the live streaming services improved the quality, resolution and accessibility.
    This creates a constantly evolving metagame in which the average player doesn’t stand a chance against diehards striving to be the best. <br />
    here some examples of the top competitive games tody:
     <h2 style="font-family:'Retro Gaming'; color:green"> Overwatch (PS4, Xbox One, PC)</h2>
    Overwatch may not have been the first hero-shooter; however, it’s gone on to dominate the genre while also solidifying its presence in esports with the existence of the Overwatch League.
    This is in part due to Blizzard’s obsession with rebalancing the game and in some cases completely reworking how a character plays.
    <h2 style="font-family:'Retro Gaming'; color:green"> CS:GO (PC)</h2>
    Since making the switch to free-to-play in 2018, CS:GO has seen an uptick in popularity that’s led to a thriving competitive scene surrounding the game.
    Consistent content drops such as new maps, characters, weapons, and game modes have played a major role in keeping the game feeling fresh after all these years.
    In my opinion cs:go is the best game ever.
    <h2 style="font-family:'Retro Gaming'; color:green"> Dota 2 (PC)</h2>
    Dota 2 is another Valve title that’s managed to stand the test of time and still holds onto the title of “most-played game on Steam”.
    It’s able to maintain an active playerbase by avoiding many of the pitfalls that free-to-play MOBAs often fall prey to, such as content paywalls and poor competitive balancing.
    <h2 style="font-family:'Retro Gaming'; color:green"> Fortnite (PS4, Xbox One, Switch, PC)</h2>
    Fortnite’s rise to fame has been interesting to watch unfold, transitioning from a run of the mill battle-royale game into a fully-supported competitive esport.
    It makes sense when you consider how large of an impact Fortnite has had on gaming culture overall, in addition to the rise of the battle-royale genre.
    <h2 style="font-family:'Retro Gaming'; color:green"> Rocket League (PS4, Xbox One, Switch, PC)</h2>
    Rocket League has come a long way since its 2015 release, going on to become one of the most popular esports today.
    As one of the few games to offer full cross-play across all major platforms, the vehicular soccer game has amassed a large playerbase that developer Psyonix is committed to keeping.
    this game going to be in the next Olympic Games and every 6 mounth it has its own championship.
